					<h1 style="color: #353190;">Project Description</h1>
					<h3 style="color: #353190;">Midnight in Night City was a project that I did for a class called Object Oriented Design Principles. We were tasked with creating our own game while also implementing these different design principles into the overall workflow and code base of the game. This game used mainly Java as the main language to implement all the different features that the game had such as the fighting mechanics, defending mechanics, and the winning mechanics. The game futher also used different object oriented design principles such as encapsulation, polymorphism, etc. The time that it took to complete the game too approximately 30 minutes, if everything went smoothly.</h3>

                <h3 style="color: #353190;">The game was inspired by the hit game Cyberpunk 2077. Where you as the player had the opportunity to pick between three different classes that gave you different stats. From these stats they would allow for you to either easily complete certain missions that were layed out or better attack certain enemies. The enemies of the game were randomly generated from an array of enemies, from here the enemies would randonly attack you regardless of what level you were as I was trying to stay true to the nature of the actual game where you can always easily encounter higher level enemies anywhere. The only was to win the game was to become a Night City Legend basically beating every enemy and reaching the max level of the game.</h3>

                <h2 style="color: #353190;" >Techniques</h2>
                <h3 style="color: #353190;">This game used various object oriented techniques that were specifically catered to provide the game with ease when a user was playing it. I used techniques such as a factory to generate different enemies and items dynamically so that the player does not recieve the same item twice or even the same rarity twice. The enemies were also generaated dynamically allowing for a unique experience for every user that played the game. I also implemented an observer that basically watches what happens during the game and then notifies the subscribers of what is happening. The subscribers were designed to then populate certain areas of the games with various items depending on what events they were recieving from the observers. Overall for this project I used all of the techniques I learned in the past as well as learned recently to make sure that the game was playable and stayed true to the inspiration that I got it from.</h3>
